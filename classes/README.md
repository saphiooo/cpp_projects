# Classes
Practice using classes with .h files, constructors and destructors, and inheritance with different kinds of media: music, movies, and video games.

ADD adds a new kind of media (music, movie, or video game).

SEARCH searches for media based on title (t) or year (y). 

DELETE deletes media (and can delete multiple at a time).

PRINT prints all media. use this for debugging purposes.

QUIT quits the program.

To compile:

```g++ *.cpp```

Then:

```ls```

If running an executable (`a.exe`), run with

```./a```

Otherwise, for a `.out` file,

```./a.out```
