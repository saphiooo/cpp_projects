# Graph Creator

A program that can create weighted, directed graphs, and search for the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Commands are very self-explanatory.

- ADD VERTEX: add a vertex

- ADD EDGE: add an edge

- RM VERTEX: remove a vertex

- RM EDGE: remove an edge

- SHORTEST PATH: find the shortest path between two vertexes

- PRINT: prints out the adjacency matrix (for debugging purposes)

- QUIT: quit the program
