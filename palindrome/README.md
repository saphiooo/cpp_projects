# Palindrome
Checking if something is a palindrome!

Enter a string of text after the prompt; the program will tell you if the input is a palindrome or not.

Examples of palindromes: "kayak", "Mr. Owl ate my metal worm", "racecar"

Not examples of palindromes: "not a palindrome", "palindrome"

Examples that are palindromes but will not be processed by the program: "....", "())(" (the program will ignore non-alphanumeric characters).
