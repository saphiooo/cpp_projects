# Shunting Yard

A Shunting Yard algorithm, written in C++. The algorithm accepts an infix expression and converts the expression to postfix (reverse Polish notation). The postfix expression is then used to create an expression tree. The expression tree is finally utilized to output the same expression in prefix, infix, or postfix, based on user input.

Commands:

- INPUT: Input a legal infix expression with single-digit characters, each separated by spaces, and the addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (^) operators.

- OUTPUT: Output the expression in either prefix, infix, or postfix

- QUIT: Quit the program
