# Student Hash

A similar program to Student List, but with hash tables.

`parseNames.py` is a Python file used to convert an initial file of names into more readable `.txt` files of names (see: `fnames.txt`, `lnames.txt`). 

When running this program, `g++ *.cpp` to compile and `./a.exe` or `./a.out` to run is enough. Do not run the Python file.
